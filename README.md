# Weight Tracker Android App

This is a simple Android application built with Java in Android Studio that allows users to register, log in, track their weight over time, and visualize their progress in a chart. The app uses SQLite for data storage and includes basic permission handling.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with a username and password (minimum 6 characters).
- **Weight Tracking**: Add, update, delete, and view weight entries with dates.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores user data and weight entries in an SQLite database.
- **Data Display**: Shows all weight entries in a list view.
- **Chart Visualization**: Displays weight data in a WebView using a local HTML chart (loaded from assets).
- **Permission Handling**: Requests SMS permission (demonstrates runtime permissions, though SMS functionality is placeholder).

## Key Components

- **`DatabaseHelper.java`**: Manages SQLite database creation and operations (users and weight entries tables).
- **`LoginActivity.java`**: Handles user login and registration with SharedPreferences for session management.
- **`MainActivity.java`**: Main screen with navigation to login, data display, chart, and permission request activities.
- **`DataDisplayActivity.java`**: Allows users to input and view weight entries.
- **`ChartActivity.java`**: Renders a chart using a WebView and JavaScript, pulling data from the database.
- **`PermissionRequestActivity.java`**: Demonstrates requesting SMS permission (placeholder functionality).
- **`WeightEntry.java`**: Model class for weight entry data.

## Database Schema

- **Users Table**: Stores `id` (auto-increment), `username` (unique), and `password`.
- **Weight Entries Table**: Stores `id` (auto-increment), `date`, `weight`, and `user_id` (foreign key to Users).

## Build Configuration

The app uses a Gradle build configuration written in Kotlin Script (`build.gradle.kts`). Key settings include:

- **Namespace**: `com.example.androidstudiointro`
- **SDK Versions**: 
  - Compile SDK: 34
  - Minimum SDK: 28
  - Target SDK: 34
- **Version**: 1.0 (versionCode: 1)
- **Dependencies**:
  - AndroidX libraries: `appcompat`, `material`, `activity`, `constraintlayout`, `recyclerview`
  - Gson: `com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1`
  - Testing: `junit`, `ext.junit`, `espresso.core`
- **Java Compatibility**: Java 8
- **Build Types**: Release build with minification disabled and default ProGuard rules.

See `app/build.gradle.kts` for the full configuration.

## Usage

1. Launch the app and navigate to the login screen from the main activity.
2. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
3. Add weight entries with dates in the data display screen.
4. View all entries in a list or visualize them in the chart activity.
5. Optionally, test SMS permission requesting (no actual SMS sent).

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Minimum API level 28 (Android 9.0 Pie)
- Local `chart.html` file in the `assets` folder for chart rendering

## Notes

- Passwords are stored in plain text (for simplicity; consider encryption in production).
- The chart relies on a JavaScript function (`drawChart`) in `chart.html`, which is not included here.
- SMS functionality is a placeholder and requires further implementation.
